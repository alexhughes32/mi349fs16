Sorry it was late, I realized after trying to problem solve why my documents were not linking up to my github account i realized I didn't
commit my week1 folder to git. So that was why it was late, and I was working on adv 324 intro to creative media so that's why the 
titles on the documents in the folder are wrong, I guess I didn't pay attention to detail. Again, sorry about the delay and sorry I had to 
start off on a bad not with getting a 20% deduction. 

Have a good night.
