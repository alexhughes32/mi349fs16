<h1> A little about myself</h1>

<p>Ask you can tell from the banner, my name is Alex Hughes. I am a third year student here at Michigan State University. I am majoring in Advertising, focus on creative, Media and Information, focus in Media Production, and a minor in Pubilc Relations. With all of this I hope to have a career where I can help tell a story. Whether that's my own, or a story for someone else, or for a company, I'm not entirely sure. I just know I love being behind a camera and meeting new people.</p>

<p>The reason I am taking this class is because I want to make myself as marketable as I can and I feel like knowing these computer skills will help me once I get into the "real" workforce. I mean, I personally think it's pretty cool creating all of this stuff as well, I just want to be able to do a lot of this on my own and expand my personal knowledge. </p>
